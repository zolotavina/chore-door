# Chore Door

Chore-Door is a fun and simple door-clicking game where players must try to avoid the hidden chore-bot behind one of three doors. The player selects doors one at a time, aiming to open all doors without uncovering the robot. Behind each door could be the chore-bot or a relaxing scene, and the goal is to outsmart the random placement of the chore-bot.

The game continues until the player wins by opening all safe doors or loses by uncovering the chore-bot. After each game, players have the option to play again with a new randomized door arrangement.
